blockquote, ordered_list, and unordered_list:

1) Create a new function parse_blocks_with_lines<'a>(lines: &[&'a str]) -> Vec<Block<'a>>, refactoring as needed
2) In each of blockquote, ordered_list, and unordered_list, `content` will be built out of trimmed-down lines from
    the original input

link.rs:
Same approach as above should work, but MIGHT have to unconditionally convert to Cow::Owned instead? Unsure, haven't looked
closely enough.


Also, need to add a to_owned function on Block and Span that will convert Block<'a> into Block<'static> recursively.
